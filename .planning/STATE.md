# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-03)

**Core value:** Autofill should work reliably — the right card and address fill the right fields with zero friction.
**Current focus:** Phase 3 — Address Filtering (next)

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 3 (Address Filtering) — planned; ready to execute
Plan: 03-01 (UI surface, wave 1) + 03-02 (filter wiring + empty-state, wave 2, depends_on 03-01)
Status: Plans verified PASSED on first pass; run `/gsd-execute-phase 3`
Last activity: 2026-05-03 -- Phase 3 plans created (committed f37bd29) and verified by gsd-plan-checker

Progress: [██████░░░░] 67%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Init: Address-card relationship is round-robin (no FK); filtering is the selection mechanism
- Init: "No address available" is an isolated bug, not caused by import sync timing
- Init: Address filter lives in popup UI (user-driven, not auto-detected from page)
- Phase 1: Convert `POST /api/addresses/import` from 202 + background IIFE to inline awaited insert returning 200
- Phase 1: Wire `onAddressesImported` callback prop from App into AdminOptions; AdminOptions calls it after successful import
- Phase 1: Import button shows in-flight state via local `isImporting` boolean + RefreshCw spinner (mirror of `handleGenerateCard`)
- Phase 1: Card import explicitly out of scope — handleGenerateCard already self-refreshes; PROJECT/ROADMAP cleanup deferred to next transition
- Phase 1: Post-import refresh failures shown inline; no auto-retry (recovery = reopen popup)
- Roadmap: Swapped Phase 2 ↔ Phase 3 — Address Display Debug now precedes Address Filtering (filtering can't be validated until the "No address available" bug is fixed). Phase 3 (filtering) now depends on Phase 2 (debug).
- 2026-05-03: Phase 2 detail extracted out of ROADMAP.md and isolated into `.planning/phases/02-address-display-debug/02-DEBUG-CONTEXT.md` so the work can be offloaded to `/gsd-debug` as a self-contained bundle (symptom, hypotheses ranked, touchpoints, repro). REQUIREMENTS traceability table corrected to match the post-swap phase numbers.
- Phase 2 root cause: schema drift — `addresses.excluded_until` column declared in `schema.sql` but missing from the deployed Supabase table. PostgREST 500 on `?activeOnly=true` was forwarded as the addresses payload by the background handler (no `res.ok` check), causing the popup to silently render "No address available" for every card row.
- Phase 2 fix path: A — restore the column on the live DB via manual SQL migration (user-authorized) + harden `GET_ADDRESSES` background handler with `res.ok` check so future server 5xx responses surface as visible errors instead of silent empty pools. Path D (derive cooldown from `last_used` + global TTL) considered and rejected — would amputate per-row cooldown design across server, popup, and types.
- 2026-05-03: Phase 3 design revised — replace cascading state→city dropdowns with a single freeform search input that matches case-insensitive substring against `city` OR `state` (one match in either column is sufficient). Rationale: faster UX, supports partial matches like "tex" hitting both Texas state and Texarkana city. ROADMAP.md Phase 3 + REQUIREMENTS.md FILTER-01..04 updated; requirement IDs preserved for traceability.
- Phase 3 (Discuss, 2026-05-03):
  - UI placement: stacked full-width input directly below the existing card search; placeholder "Filter addresses by city or state"; no inline match counter (D-01..D-03)
  - Match semantics: single literal substring, `trim().toLowerCase().includes(...)` against `city` OR `state` only (no `name`/`street`/`zip`); no whitespace tokenization (D-04..D-06)
  - Pairing: `filteredAddresses` derives from `activeAddresses` (excluded filter runs first); round-robin at `App.tsx:413-416` switches to the filtered pool (D-07..D-09)
  - Empty state: distinct per-card "No address matches filter" copy when filter has zero matches; existing "No address available" preserved when the active pool is genuinely empty (D-10..D-12)
  - Persistence: none — `useState` only, resets on each popup open, mirrors the card search (D-13)
  - Backend: no changes; popup-only phase (D-14)
  - PROJECT.md FILTER-01/02 corrected to remove stale "state and then city" language

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2 unblocks once user runs the SQL migration in Supabase (see `.planning/phases/02-address-display-debug/02-FIX.md` §1). Until then, `?activeOnly=true` will continue to 500 server-side; the hardened background handler now surfaces it as a visible error instead of silent emptiness.
- Latent: `POST /api/autofill/mark_used` writes `excluded_until` (`server/index.ts:530`) and will 500 on the first address autofill until the same SQL migration runs. Resolved by the same migration; explicitly captured in `02-DEBUG-LOG.md` §7.

### Phase 2 Follow-ups (deferred, captured)

- Schema drift cleanup: live `addresses` has `external_id`, `first_name`, `last_name` columns not in `schema.sql`. Reconcile in a separate schema-hygiene pass.
- `CLAUDE.md` "Address data flow" doc drift: claims `SELECT … WHERE user_id = ?`, but `addresses` has no `user_id` column and the route doesn't filter by user.
- Sibling background handlers in `src/background/index.ts` likely share the `.then(res => res.json())` anti-pattern — sweep for `res.ok` hardening (out of Phase 2 scope per instruction).
